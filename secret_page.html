            <p>Head of the russian crime scen in New York City, Viggo Tarasov. Small-time & son of Viggo, Iosef Tarasof: We tried to steal his car. Kill his dog. Kill him during his sleeps with 12 trained assassins. We also tried to put 2M$ contract on his head. None of that worked. <br></p>
            
            <p>Italian crime lord, Santino D'Antonio. Santino's crew, Cassian & Ares: We tried to change the contract on his head to 7M$, we also tried to crash his car while he was driving & to explod him and his house with grenade launcher. None of that worked. <br></p>
                Winston owner othe the New York City Continental, hotel known as the assassin's lair & Zero henchman of the organization: We tried to double the contract, changing it to 14M$ and to excomunicate him from the under world, leaving him with no portection from the organization. Then we shot him and made him fall to his death from the Continental hotel. None of that worked <br>
                Vincent Bisset, The "Marquis de Gramont", high rank in the assassins organisation & Caine, the right arm of Vincent Bisset : We raised the rewward to 40M$ and trapped John on a duel where he got chased by every assassins in the world all night before reaching the duel place. <br> 
                The rumors says he died at the end of the last duel. We have proves that the rumors are wrong. In fact: none of that worked.
                To sumarize, John Wick is alive and has a total of 439 victims recorded. Today, we are setting up the contract to 100$ dollars to bring his head at any Continental hotel.
                We are counting on your skills to hunt him, find him and kill him!
