          The rumors says he died at the end of the last duel. We have proves
          that the rumors are wrong. <br />In fact: None of that worked. <br />
          To sumarize, John Wick is alive and has a total of 439 victims
          recorded. Today, we are setting up the contract to 100M$ dollars to
          bring his head at any Continental hotel. <br />
