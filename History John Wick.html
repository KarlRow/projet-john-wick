            <h4 class="icon-text">John Wick 1</h4>
            <p>In New York City, John Wick is grieving the death of his wife Helen, who had arranged for him to receive
                a beagle puppy to help cope with his loss. A few days later, a group of Russian gangsters, led by Iosef
                Tarasov, accost John at a gas station and fail to intimidate him into selling them his 1969 Boss 429
                Mustang.[b] That night, they break into John's home, assault him, kill the puppy, and steal the car.
                Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but the shop owner, Aurelio,
                recognizes it and refuses service. Aurelio informs John that Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the boss
                of New York City's Russian mafia.

                Upon learning of his son's actions, Viggo berates Iosef for incurring John's wrath. He reveals John was
                once a hitman in his employ, and was renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the Baba Yaga, a
                ruthless, relentless "man of focus, commitment, and sheer will". After John fell in love with Helen, a
                civilian, Viggo gave him a seemingly impossible task to earn his freedom; he succeeded.

                John recovers a concealed stash from his former career that includes weapons and gold coins. He refuses
                Viggo's attempt to make amends for his son's actions and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his
                home. Viggo puts a $2 million bounty on John and enlists his former mentor, Marcus, to kill him. John
                lodges at the Continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld and where
                conducting criminal business is forbidden. Winston, the hotel's owner and John's old friend, informs him
                that Iosef is at a nightclub called Red Circle. John infiltrates Red Circle and confronts Iosef, but he
                is attacked by Viggo's henchman Kirill and forced to retreat to the Continental for medical attention.

                As John rests, a hitwoman, Ms. Perkins, sneaks into his room. Marcus sees Perkins from an adjacent
                building and fires a warning shot to alert John, who wakes up and subdues her. Perkins reveals Viggo has
                doubled the bounty for her to kill John in the hotel and has concealed a high-value stash in a church.
                John hires another hitman, Harry, to secure Perkins but she kills Harry and escapes.

                At the church, John destroys Viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. When Viggo arrives
                to assess the damage, John assaults him and his men but is hit by Kirill's car and captured. John tells
                Viggo he will not stop until Iosef is dead because the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone
                in his grief for Helen. Marcus again intervenes to save John, who kills Kirill and threatens Viggo into
                revealing Iosef's location in a safehouse. John assaults the safehouse and kills Iosef. Marcus
                encourages John to return to his everyday life. Perkins witnesses this and reveals Marcus's duplicity to
                Viggo, who has him tortured and killed. Viggo calls John to taunt him with the details, drawing him back
                to the city.

                Winston has Perkins executed for breaking the Continental's rules, then informs John that Viggo is
                preparing to leave the city by helicopter. John races to New York Harbor, where he fights and mortally
                wounds Viggo. John, resigned to dying from his injuries, watches on his phone a video of Helen telling
                him they need to go home. He breaks into a nearby animal clinic, treats his wounds, and adopts a pit
                bull puppy scheduled to be euthanized before beginning to walk home.</p>

            <h4 class="icon-text">John Wick 2</h4>

            <p>John Wick recovers his stolen Ford Mustang from Abram Tarasov, the late Viggo's brother. Wick
                dispatches Tarasov's men in a violent rampage that heavily damages the Mustang but spares Tarasov under
                the promise of peace and returns home. Wick has his Mustang taken for repairs by chop-shop owner
                Aurelio.

                John is visited by the Camorra crime boss Santino D'Antonio, who reminds him that he helped John
                complete his "impossible task," which allowed John to retire and marry Helen. In return, John swore to a
                "marker," an unbreakable vow symbolized by a "blood oath" medallion. Santino presents the marker to
                demand services from John, who declines, so Santino retaliates by destroying John's house with a grenade
                launcher. John survives and travels to the Continental Hotel in New York City, where Winston reminds him
                that if he rejects the marker, he will violate one of the underworld's two unbreakable rules: no killing
                on Continental grounds and honoring every marker. John reluctantly accepts his commitment and meets with
                Santino, who tasks him with assassinating his sister, Gianna, so that he can claim her seat at the "High
                Table," a council of twelve high-level crime bosses. Santino sends Ares, his mute bodyguard, to observe
                John's mission.

                In Rome, Italy, John infiltrates Gianna's coronation, confronting her in her dressing room. Faced with
                certain death, Gianna chooses to slit her wrists. As Gianna dies, John shoots her in the head to end her
                suffering and fulfill the marker. As John leaves, Gianna's bodyguard, Cassian, recognizes him, realizes
                that he was sent to kill Gianna, and attacks him. John flees to the catacombs, where he is
                double-crossed by Ares and Santino's henchmen, who intend to tie up "loose ends" by killing him. After
                killing most of the henchmen, John is again pursued by Cassian. Their fight leads them into the Rome
                Continental's reception area, where "conducting business" is strictly forbidden, like the New York
                Continental. As the two share a drink, John explains his reason for killing Gianna. Nevertheless,
                Cassian promises John a quick and clean death as a sign of professional respect.

                Julius, the Roman Continental's manager, arranges safe passage for John back to New York as Santino
                opens a contract for $7 million to kill John, ostensibly to avenge his sister's death. This leads
                numerous assassins to unsuccessfully attack John, during which Winston visits Santino to complete the
                marker, thus freeing John from being unable to move against him. Winston warns Santino that he "stabbed
                the devil in the back" and that he will be unprepared for John's wrath.

                Injured from numerous attempted assassinations, John is then confronted by Cassian in the subway. After
                a vicious fight culminating in Cassian being stabbed in the aorta, John spares him. The badly injured
                John seeks help from an underground crime boss known as the Bowery King, whose subordinates treat John's
                injuries. Intrigued by John's intent to kill a member of the High Table, the Bowery King sportingly
                gives him a Kimber M1911 pistol with only seven bullets, one for each million of the contract. He
                directs John to an art museum where Santino holds a gala. John pursues Santino throughout the museum,
                killing his remaining henchmen, including Ares, who gives Santino enough time to escape to the
                Continental, where he intends to remain indefinitely in its sanctuary. Despite Winston's warnings, the
                exasperated John shoots and kills Santino in the Continental lounge.

                The next day, Winston meets with John and explains that the Camorra has doubled the contract on John,
                offering it globally. Further, for "conducting business" on Continental grounds, per the High Table's
                rules, Winston is forced to declare John "excommunicado," terminating all his access and privileges to
                underworld resources. However, Winston delays activating John's excommunication by one hour (giving him
                a head start) and provides him with a marker for future use. Before leaving, John advises Winston to
                warn every other High Table assassin that he will kill anyone who tries to hunt him. John departs with
                his dog as Winston makes a call enacting John's "excommunicado" to be activated in one hour. As news of
                the imminent contract disseminates, cellular phones ring all around, and John begins to run.

            <h4 class="icon-text">Parrabellum</h4>
            <p>John Wick is making his way through Manhattan before he is labeled "excommunicado" for the unauthorized
                killing of High Table crime lord Santino D'Antonio on Continental grounds.At the New York Public
                Library, John retrieves a marker medallion and a rosary. He is injured in a fight with another hitman,
                Ernest, and seeks medical treatment from an underworld doctor. His excommunicado status activates before
                the doctor can finish, forcing John to complete the suturing himself. Upon leaving, he is quickly
                pursued by various gangs of assassins, all of whom he kills. <br>

                John meets with The Director, the head of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, to whom he presents a rosary
                and demands safe passage to Casablanca. As John was once a member, the Director reluctantly agrees. It's
                also revealed that John Wick's birth name was Jardani Jovonovich. Meanwhile, a High Table Adjudicator
                meets with New York Continental manager Winston and the Bowery King, notifying them that they both have
                seven days to resign from their positions as a consequence of helping John.The Adjudicator enlists
                Zero, a Japanese assassin, and orders him to stab the Director through both of her hands as penance for
                aiding John. In Casablanca, John meets Sofia, his former friend and manager of the Moroccan Continental. <br>

                John presents the marker, which binds Sofia to return a debt to John; John rescued Sofia's daughter and
                put her in hiding. John demands to be directed to the Elder, the only person above the High Table. Sofia
                begrudgingly takes John to Berrada, her former boss, who tells John he may find the Elder by wandering
                through the desert until he can no longer walk. When Sofia refuses to give Berrada one of her trained
                Belgian Malinois, he shoots the dog but hits its bulletproof vest. John prevents Sofia from killing
                Berrada. They fight their way out of the kasbah and drive into the desert, where she leaves John. Seven
                days later, the Adjudicator and Zero confront the Bowery King, who refuses to abdicate his position. In
                response, Zero's students slaughter the Bowery King's men while Zero slashes the Bowery King seven times
                with a wakizashi. Meanwhile, John collapses in the desert and is brought to The Elder. John states that
                he wants to live to keep the memory of the love he once had with his late wife.The Elder agrees to
                forgive John if John kills Winston and remains subservient to the High Table for the remainder of his
                life. To show his fealty, John severs his ring finger and gives his wedding ring to The Elder.<br>

                John returns to New York and is attacked by Zero and his students before reaching the protection of the
                Continental. The Adjudicator arrives, but Winston refuses to abdicate, and John refuses to kill him,
                leading the Adjudicator to revoke the Continental's neutral status and send both Zero and an army of
                heavily armed High Table enforcers to kill John and Winston. Winston provides John with weapons and the
                assistance of concierge Charon and his staff. After killing all the enforcers, John is ambushed by Zero
                and his students; John proceeds to kill all but two. Zero battles John but is eventually defeated and
                left to die. On the roof of the Continental, The Adjudicator agrees to a parley with Winston, who offers
                allegiance to the High Table.<br>

                John arrives; Winston shoots him, and John falls to the street below. Winston reassumes his position,
                and the severely injured John is secretly delivered to the Bowery King in an underground bunker; the two
                agree to join forces against the High Table.</p>

            <h4 class="icon-text">Chapitre 4</h4>
            <p>In New York City, John Wick prepares to exact vengeance against the High Table while hiding underground
                with the Bowery King. He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder, the "one who sits above the Table". In
                response, the Marquis Vincent Bisset de Gramont, a High Table member, summons New York Continental hotel
                manager Winston and his concierge, Charon, explains that the High Table has given him unlimited
                resources to kill John, and chastises Winston for previously failing to do so. As punishment, the
                Marquis strips Winston of his managerial duties, declares him "excommunicado", destroys the New York
                Continental, and executes Charon. The Marquis then enlists Caine a blind, retired High Table assassin
                to kill his old friend John, threatening to murder Caine's daughter if he refuses.

                John takes refuge at the Osaka Continental, run by his friend Shimazu Koji. The Marquis'
                second-in-command Chidi, backed by High Table assassins and Caine, arrives to investigate the hotel.
                Koji's daughter Akira, the hotel's concierge, evacuates the hotel just before the High Table
                "deconsecrates" it, igniting a melee. John fights through waves of armored assassins, leading to a
                showdown against Caine. "Mr. Nobody", a bounty hunter, interrupts their fight and allows John to escape
                after determining the current bounty for killing John to be insufficient. A wounded Koji repeatedly
                attacks Caine on John's behalf; Caine reluctantly kills Koji but spares Akira.

                John returns to New York and meets with a vengeful Winston at Charon's gravesite. Winston suggests that
                John invoke an old High Table tradition to challenge the Marquis to a duel. Winning would free John of
                all obligations to the High Table, but he can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family. John
                travels to the Berlin headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, with whom he had severed ties, to
                request readmission. His adoptive sister Katia stipulates that for readmission, John must kill Killa
                Harkan, a High Table member who murdered her father. Killa sets up an ambush at his nightclub, but with
                the aid of Caine and Mr. Nobody, John manages to kill him and regain his status.

                Winston relays John's challenge to the Marquis, acting as John's 'second', and requests that, should
                John win, the New York Continental be rebuilt, fully funded by the High Table. In Paris, John and the
                Marquis decide on the duel's parameters dueling pistols at sunrise the following day at Sacré-Cœur 
                in a meeting moderated by the Harbinger, the Table's emissary. The Marquis nominates a reluctant Caine
                to take his place, while the Harbinger warns that John and Winston will be executed should either fail
                to appear on time. The Bowery King arrives in Paris to give John a pistol and a new ballistic suit.

                The Marquis intends to prevent John from arriving at the duel in time by placing a $26 million bounty on
                him. John fights off hordes of assassins on his way to Sacré-Cœur, including Mr. Nobody, who negotiates
                a bounty increase to $40 million. During their confrontation, John prevents Chidi from killing Mr.
                Nobody's dog, causing Mr. Nobody to abandon his pursuit of John. After Caine and Mr. Nobody assists John
                in fighting off several assassins including Chidi, whom Mr. Nobody kills on the Rue Foyatier, they
                reach the summit just in time for the duel. John and Caine wound each other through two rounds of
                dueling, and the third round comes to a halt when Caine severely wounds John. Demanding the right to
                administer the coup de grâce, the Marquis eagerly swaps places with Caine. Winston chides the Marquis
                for his arrogance, revealing that John has not yet fired his third bullet; John shoots the Marquis dead.

                The Harbinger grants Caine and John their freedom from the High Table, and Winston is reinstated. John
                reflects upon his life and marriage before succumbing to his injuries. Sometime later, back in New York,
                Winston and the Bowery King bid farewell to John at his grave, located next to that of his late wife
                Helen.

                In a post-credits scene, Caine returns to Paris to reunite with his daughter but is approached by a
                vengeful, knife-wielding Akira.</p>
